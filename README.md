# My Start Page

## Setup

* The background image is set within `./src.js` on line `8`. Just chage the path within the `url()` to whatever you want to change the background.
* The image inside the box is set within `./style.css` on line `138`, again just change the path within the `url()`.
* The bookmarks are set within `./index.html` on `<div class="tabs-item item-2">` on line `48`.
    * I've done it so it works well for a 3x2 items. Right now, it has some Japanese for the titles, just find it and replace it with what you want.
    * If you want to add more items to a bookmark section, just add more `li` and make sure to follow how the other items are set.

That's it. I haven't checked this on any other browser (I'm using Vivaldi) or other machines and although the code I've written is absolutely shocking, it should work fine.
